# Vim config

These are my Vim configuration files based on Jon Gjengset's [configs repository](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs) repository.
The configuration has been tested for Windows Subsystem for Linux with an Ubuntu distro.
VIM 8.1 was also compiled from source following [these](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source) instructions.

# Usage

Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/ramonimbao/vimconfig ~/.vim`
